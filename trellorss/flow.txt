Trello Events will come from one of two locations:

    1.) Received webhooks
    2.) API requests

If you want to do an API request, first create a TrelloRSS object, and call the relevant "get" method. That will return some json that will need to be formatted by 'to_rss'. Our callback handler will get json from Trello and also call trello-rss. Since it already has the json, it just immediately can call 'to_rss' with the received info. (Make sure we're getting things in the same format; might have to call some preprocessing method first on the hooks). 

Need to think about persistance. Not sure how the current memcache method will work w/hooks.
